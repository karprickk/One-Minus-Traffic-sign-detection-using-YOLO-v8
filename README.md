TRAFFIC SIGN DETECTION USING YOLO v8 

This project aims to enhance road safety and traffic management through the development of an advanced Traffic Sign Detection system based on the latest iteration of the
You Only Look Once (YOLO) framework, YOLO v8. The primary objective is to accurately identify and classify traffic signs in real-time, providing crucial information for autonomous
vehicles and driver assistance systems. The methodology leverages YOLO v8 for its exceptional speed and accuracy in object detection, coupled with a comprehensive dataset of
traffic signs for training and validation.
